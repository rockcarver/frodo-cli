 * This script lets you to derive the configuration for a dynamic JWT issuer from the issuer string.
 * A JWT issuer is made up of the following:
 *   - issuer - the identifier of the entity that issues JWTs
 *   - resource owner subject claim - the name of the claim in the JWT that identifies the resource owner
 *   - consented scope claim - the name of the claim in the JWT that represents scope that the resource owner
 *                             has already consented to externally
 *   - authorized subjects - the set of principal identifiers that are authorized to be used as resource owners
 *                           by the issuer
 *   - JWKs - either a set of JWKs or connection details for obtaining that set, that are the public keys that
 *            can verify the signature on the issued JWTs.
 *
 * Defined variables:
 * issuer - String
 *          The issuer from the bearer JWT.
 * realm - String
 *         The path of the realm that is handling the request.
 * scriptName - String.
 *              Always present, the display name of the script.
 * logger - Always present, the script debug logger instance:
 *          https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/7/scripting-guide/scripting-api-global-logger.html#scripting-api-global-logger.
 *          Corresponding log files will be prefixed with: scripts.OAUTH2_SCRIPTED_JWT_ISSUER.
 * httpClient - HTTP Client (1).
 *              Always present, the HTTP Client instance:
 *              https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/7/scripting-guide/scripting-api-global-http-client.html#scripting-api-global-http-client.
 * idRepository - Identity Repository (2). Always present.
 * secrets - Secrets accessor (3). Always present.
 *
 * Return - org.forgerock.oauth2.core.TrustedJwtIssuerConfig (4) - the configuration of the trusted JWT issuer.
