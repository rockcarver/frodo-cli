/**
 * The following script is a simplified template for understanding how to build
 * up a config Map object with custom values. The Config Provider Node will then
 * provide this config Map to the desired node type. It is important that the Map
 * you build here is named 'config'.
 *
 * Defined variables:
 *
 * nodeState - Node State (1)
 *           Always present, this represents the current values stored in the node state.
 *
 * idRepository - Profile Data (2)
 *           Always present, a repository to retrieve user information.
 *
 * secrets - Credentials and Secrets (3)
 *           Always present, an interface to access the Secrets API from a scripting context.
 *
 * requestHeaders (4) - Map (5)
 *           Always present, an object that provides methods for accessing headers in the login request.
 *
 * logger - Debug Logging (6)
 *          Always present, the debug logger instance.
 *
 * httpClient - HTTP Client (7)
 *          Always present, the HTTP client that can be used to make external HTTP requests.
 *
 * realm - String (primitive).
 *          Always present, the name of the realm the user is authenticating to.
 *
 * existingSession - Map<String, String> (5)
 *          Present if the request contains the session cookie, the user's session object. The returned map from
 *          SSOToken.getProperties() (8)
 *
 * requestParameters - Map (5)
 *          Always present, the object that contains the authentication request parameters.
 *
 *
 * Outputs:
 *
 * config - Map (5)
 *           Define and fill a Map object named 'config' with custom values, this will define the configuration for the
 *           associated node selected in the ConfigProviderNode.
