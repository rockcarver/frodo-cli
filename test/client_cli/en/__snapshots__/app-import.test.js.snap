  -A, --all-separate    Import all applications from separate files
                        (*.app.json) in the current directory. Ignored with -i
                        or -a.
  --curlirize           Output all network calls in curl format.

                        certain behavior like obtaining an Identity Management
                        admin token or not and whether to export/import
                        referenced email templates or how to walk through the
                        tenant admin login flow of Identity Cloud and handle
