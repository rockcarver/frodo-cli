  --propmt-prune                       Will prompt for Frodo Journey Prune on
                                       all realms (default: false)
  -S --effect-secrets                  Will effect the secrets, otherwise we
                                       will not change the secrets but will
                                       compare them (default: false)

  --target <host url>                  Host URL of the environment to perform
                                       secret value encryption. The URL must
                                       resolve to an existing connection
                                       profile. Use this option to generate an
                                       export that can be imported into the
                                       target environment without requiring

  -W --wait-secrets                    When secrets are effected we need to run
                                       a refresh on the enviornment. This will
                                       cause the command to wait until the
                                       refresh is finished. (default: false)
  --what-if                            Runs a what if of the comparison, so it
                                       wont do any changes (default: false)

Environment Variables:
  FRODO_HOST: AM base URL. Overridden by 'host' argument.
  FRODO_IDM_HOST: IDM base URL. Overridden by '--idm-host' option.
  FRODO_REALM: Realm. Overridden by 'realm' argument.
  FRODO_USERNAME: Username. Overridden by 'username' argument.
  FRODO_PASSWORD: Password. Overridden by 'password' argument.
  FRODO_LOGIN_CLIENT_ID: OAuth2 client id for IDM API calls. Overridden by '--login-client-id' option.
  FRODO_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URI: Redirect Uri for custom OAuth2 client id. Overridden by '--login-redirect-uri' option.
  FRODO_SA_ID: Service account uuid. Overridden by '--sa-id' option.
  FRODO_SA_JWK: Service account JWK. Overridden by '--sa-jwk-file' option but takes the actual JWK as a value, not a file name.
  FRODO_NO_CACHE: Disable token cache. Same as '--no-cache' option.
  FRODO_TOKEN_CACHE_PATH: Use this token cache file instead of '~/.frodo/TokenCache.json'.
  FRODO_CONNECTION_PROFILES_PATH: Use this connection profiles file instead of '~/.frodo/Connections.json'.
  FRODO_AUTHENTICATION_SERVICE: Name of a login journey to use.
  FRODO_DEBUG: Set to any value to enable debug output. Same as '--debug'.
  FRODO_MASTER_KEY_PATH: Use this master key file instead of '~/.frodo/masterkey.key' file.

This is used to compare two directories and automatically import and deleteconfigurations so the tenant can be promoted. It will compare a master export to a current exportand make the changes based off that diff. A file will be generated to show what has changed. 
Usage Examples:

frodo promote -M ./master -E ./export [testTenant]

This will run the promote command making the changes from master to the export, with the master being the one we are going to.

frodo promote --what-if -M ./master -E ./export [testTenant]

This will output the changes that would be made if the promote was run but will not do those changes
