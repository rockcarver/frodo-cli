"Usage: frodo config [options] [command]

Manage full cloud configuration.

Options:
  -h, --help  Help

Commands:
  export      Export full cloud configuration.
              By default, it only exports importable config (i.e. config that
              is not read-only) for the current deployment (e.g. if exporting
              from cloud, realm config would NOT be exported since it can't be
              imported back into cloud even though it can be imported into
              classic deployments). There is a flag to export all config
              including read only config.
              Additionally, there is a flag to export config for only the
              specified realm, a flag to export only global config, and many
              other flags to customize the export. Use the -h or --help to see
              them all and to also see usage examples.
  help        display help for command
  import      Import full cloud configuration.
