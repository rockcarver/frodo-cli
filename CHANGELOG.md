        `frodo authn describe <myTenant> <realm>`

        `frodo authn describe --json <myTenant> <realm>`

        `frodo authn describe <myTenant> <username> <password>`

    -   Describe authentication settings in machine-readable format (json):<br>

    -   Import authentication settings from file:<br>
        `frodo authn import -f alphaRealm.authentication.settings.json <myTenant> <realm>`

        `frodo authn import -f alphaRealm.authentication.settings.json <myTenant> <realm> <username> <password>`<br>

    -   \#217: Support `--json` with `frodo esv variable describe`.

## [2.0.0-29] - 2023-11-02

### Added

-   rockcarver/frodo-lib#53: Frodo Library now uses a file-based secure token cache to persist session and access tokens for re-use. The cached tokens are protected by the credential that was used to obtain them. Session tokens are encrypted using the hashed password as the master key, access tokens are encrypted using the hashed JWK private key as the master key. Therefore only users and processes with the correct credentials can access the tokens in the cache.

    -   The new default behavior is for Frodo CLI to use the new token cache for all applicable commands.
    -   A new global option `--no-cache` has been added to all commands to allow disabling the cache for indiviual invocations.
    -   A new environment variable `FRODO_NO_CACHE` is available to globally turn off token caching.
    -   A new environment variable `FRODO_TOKEN_CACHE_PATH` is available to instruct Frodo Library to use a non-default token cache file.

-   rockcarver/frodo-lib#340: Frodo Library now autotomatically refreshes expired session and access tokens.

    -   The new default behavior is for Frodo CLI to automatically refresh tokens. This will only ever be noticeable during long-running operations like `frodo journey prune` or `frodo esv apply` that can take longer than 15 mins to complete.

### Fixed

-   \#316: Frodo Library now properly exports scripts referenced by the `Device Match` node if the `Use Custom Matching Script` option is selected.

-   Support for authorization policies, policy sets, and resource types through new `authz` commands:

    -   `frodo authz type`    Manage authorization resource types.
        -   `delete`          Delete authorization resource types.
        -   `describe`        Describe authorization resource types.
        -   `export`          Export authorization resource types.
        -   `import`          Import authorization resource types.
        -   `list`            List authorization resource types.
    -   `frodo authz set`     Manage authorization policy sets.
        -   `delete`          Delete authorization policy sets.
        -   `describe`        Describe authorization policy sets.
        -   `export`          Export authorization policy sets.
        -   `import`          Import authorization policy sets.
        -   `list`            List authorization policy sets.
    -   `frodo authz policy`  Manage authorization policies.
        -   `delete`          Delete authorization policies.
        -   `describe`        Describe authorization policies.
        -   `export`          Export authorization policies.
        -   `import`          Import authorization policies.
        -   `list`            List authorization policies.

    Examples:

    -   Export a whole policy set including policies and resource types:<br>
        `frodo authz set export -i <myPolicySet> <myTenant>`
    -   Import a whole policy set including dependencies exported using the previous example:<br>
        `frodo authz set import -f <myPolicySet>.policyset.authz.json <myTenant>`
    -   Remove a whole policy set with all its policies:<br>
        `frodo authz set delete -i <myPolicySet> <myTenant>`
    -   Export all policies in a policy set including dependencies:<br>
        `frodo authz policy export -a --set-id <myPolicySet> <myTenant>`
    -   Import all policies into another policy set in another tenant:<br>
        `frodo authz policy import -a --set-id <myOtherPolicySet> -f <>.policy.authz.json <myOtherTenant>`<br>
        **_Note_**: Policy IDs/names have to be unique within the realm. Therefore you cannot export all policies from one policy set and import them into another policy set in the same realm without deleting the original policy set first.

    Notes:

    -   Use the new `--prereqs` option with the `authz set/policy import/export` commands to include structural prerequisites like resource types and policy sets.
    -   Use the new `--json` option with all `describe` sub-commands:<br>
        `frodo authz type describe --json -n URL <myTenant>`<br>
        `frodo authz type describe --json -i 76656a38-5f8e-401b-83aa-4ccb74ce88d2 <myTenant>`<br>
        `frodo authz set describe --json -i <myPolicySet> <myTenant>`<br>
        `frodo authz policy describe --json -i <myPolicy> <myTenant>`

### Added

-   Full support for Identity Cloud Service Accounts across all commands. Three options to leverage service accounts:

    1.  Connection profiles for daily CLI usage:

        For daily admin and development tasks, using the new `frodo conn save` command (see details under next bullet) is the easiest way to get going with service accounts. To migrate an existing connection profile to service accounts and automatically create a service account for your tenant admin, simply issue the following command:

            % frodo conn save service-accounts
            Connected to https://openam-service-accounts.forgeblocks.com/am [alpha] as user volker.scheuber@forgerock.com
            Created and added service account Frodo-SA-1673586189578 with id 99c04bba-7213-463b-9a27-ceafa8a95734 to profile.
            Saved connection profile https://openam-service-accounts.forgeblocks.com/am
            %

        Then validate your connection profile is using the new service account:

            % frodo info service-accounts
            Connected to https://openam-service-accounts.forgeblocks.com/am [alpha] as service account Frodo-SA-1673586189578 [99c04bba-7213-463b-9a27-ceafa8a95734]

        Once you have verified that your service account works, go ahead and enable MFA for your tenant admin account!

    2.  CLI parameters:

        All commands support the following new options to use service accounts:

        -   `--sa-id <uuid>` Service account's uuid. If specified, must also include `--sa-jwk-file`.
        -   `--sa-jwk-file <file>` File containing the service account's java web key (jwk). Jwk must contain private key! If specified, must also include `--sa-id`.

        This is a great way to leverage the nice UI to create and manage service accounts and then use one of the accounts with Frodo.

    3.  Environment variables for CI/CD

        For CI/CD pipelines, environment variables are preferable over command line parameters, because they are not visible in system logs:

        -   `FRODO_SA_ID`: Service account's uuid. If set, must also set `FRODO_SA_JWK`.
        -   `FRODO_SA_JWK`: Service account's java web key (jwk) as single-line string. Jwk must contain private key! If set, must also set `FRODO_SA_ID`.

-   \#143: Support Identity Cloud Service Accounts in `frodo conn save|add` command

    1.  The `frodo conn add` command is renamed to `frodo conn save` and `add` is added as an alias for backwards compatibility.
    2.  The `frodo conn save` command supports the following new options to manage service accounts:
        1.  `--sa-id <uuid>` Service account's uuid. If specified, must also include `--sa-jwk-file`. Ignored with `--no-sa`.
        2.  `--sa-jwk-file <file>` File containing the service account's java web key (jwk). Jwk must contain private key! If specified, must also include `--sa-id`. Ignored with `--no-sa`.
        3.  `--no-sa` Do not add service account.
    3.  The existing `--no-validate` option also applies to service account operations, allowing to add service account configuration to a connection profile without validating it, typical use case is an offline situation.
    4.  The `frodo conn save` command automatically creates a new service account and adds it to an existing ID Cloud profile without service account or to a new ID Cloud profile. It does not do that if the `--no-sa` option is supplied.
        1.  If `--sa-id` and `--sa-jwk-file` are supplied, `frodo conn save` adds the existing service account specified by those two parameters to the profile instead of creating a new service account.
        2.  The `frodo conn save` command checks if the ID Cloud tenant supports service accounts before performing any service account operations.
    5.  The `frodo conn save` command validates service account configuration unless the `--no-validate` options is supplied.

-   Add support for additional environment variables:

    -   `FRODO_SA_ID`: Service account's uuid. If set, must also set `FRODO_SA_JWK`.
    -   `FRODO_SA_JWK`: Service account's java web key (jwk) as single-line string. Jwk must contain private key! If set, must also set `FRODO_SA_ID`.
    -   `FRODO_AUTHENTICATION_SERVICE=journey`: Specify a login journey for frodo to use.
    -   `FRODO_MOCK=1`: Enable mocking. If enabled, frodo-lib replays recorded API responses instead of connecting to a platform instance.
    -   `FRODO_POLLY_LOG_LEVEL=info`: Frodo mock engine log level (`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `silent`). This is helpful for troubleshooting the mock capability, only.

    Environment variables added in 0.19.0:

    -   `FRODO_HOST`
    -   `FRODO_REALM`
    -   `FRODO_USERNAME`
    -   `FRODO_PASSWORD`
    -   `FRODO_SA_ID`
    -   `FRODO_SA_JWK`
    -   `FRODO_LOG_KEY`
    -   `FRODO_LOG_SECRET`
    -   `FRODO_DEBUG`

-   Enhanced the `frodo info` command to give more details for Identity Cloud tenants.

-   Warn if IDM connector servers are offline

-   Add mock mode for library to allow unit testing of clients using the library, like frodo-cli. This initial release contains minimal mock data. Enable mock mode using `FRODO_MOCK=1`.

-   \#49: Frodo now properly reports missing mandatory parameters when running `frodo esv variable describe <host>` and `frodo esv secret describe <host>`

## [0.13.0] - 2022-09-17

### Added

-   Frodo now allows two new parameters when adding a connection profile:

    \--authentication-service [service] Name of the authentication service/tree to use.

    \--authentication-header-overrides [headers] Map of headers: {"host":"am.example.com:8081"}.

    These parameters are currently only supported in the `frodo conn add` command and the configuration elements will be automatically applied to commands issued using that connection profile.

        % frodo conn add https://platform.example.com:9443/am username password --authentication-service ldapService --authentication-header-overrides '{"host":"am.example.com:8081"}' -k

    After the connection profile is created with the additional parameters, the environment can be accessed as usual. In this case it requires the `-k` parameter for every command, as the environment uses a self-signed certificate.

### Added

-   Frodo CLI is now effectively using Frodo Library for all functionality except CLI.
    -   This changes has no effect on users using frodo binaries except for the download location of those binaries, which has now shifted to the [frodo-cli](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-cli) repo [release section](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-cli/releases).
    -   This change does affect users who run Frodo in `Developer Mode`. The exact effects and required actions are not yet fully documented and understood.
    -   This change does not effect the installation/update/usage process of users running the Frodo CLI NPM package. However, under the surface there is a big change in that the [Frodo CLI (@rockcarver/frodo-cli)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rockcarver/frodo-cli) package is now built on the new [Frodo Library (@rockcarver/frodo-lib)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rockcarver/frodo-lib).

### Changed

-   The output of `frodo -v` has changed to include all three versions: cli, lib, and node:
    ```console
    % frodo -v
    cli: v0.11.1-1
    lib: v0.11.1-6
    node: v18.7.0
    ```

## [0.11.1-0] - 2022-08-19 [YANKED]

## [0.10.4] - 2022-08-13

### Added

-   \#376: Frodo is now being published as an npm package: @rockcarver/frodo-cli.
-   \#317: Binary archive names now include the release version.
-   \#369: Added backwards compatibilty with node 16 and 14. Binaries are still built using the latest node version (18). Smoke tests run against all supported versions (18, 16, 14).

### Fixed

-   \#368: Progress bar no longer overrides verbose output on journey import.

### Added

-   \#205: Added `--no-deps` option to `journey export`/`import` commands. This allows users to omit all external dependencies from a journey export and/or import. One use case where this comes in handy is when using frodo as a CI/CD tool to extract and deploy individual configuration artifacts and it is desirable to not mingle multiple types of configuration in a single file but keep each type of configuration in its own file for version and change control.
-   Added `--verbose` option to `journey export` command.
-   \#341: Added initial smoke tests to validate basic functionality.

### Changed

-   \#363: Frodo now performs dependency resolution and reports unresolved dependencies on single journey imports.
