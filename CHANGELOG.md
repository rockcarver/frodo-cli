## [3.0.3] - 2025-03-11

### Changed

- Update to frodo-lib 3.0.3

### Fixed

- \#479: Fixes issues introduced by a recent PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud release (16747.0 on 27 Feb 2025) which prevented Frodo from correctly determining the deployment type of `cloud` and led to failures in the `frodo conn save` and `frodo conn add` commands when Frodo was attempting to create service accounts with scopes that are not available in an environment.

## [3.0.2] - 2025-03-11

### Changed

- Update to frodo-lib 3.0.2

### Fixed

- \#479: Fixes issues introduced by a recent PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud release (16747.0 on 27 Feb 2025) which prevented Frodo from correctly determining the deployment type of `cloud` and led to failures in the `frodo conn save` and `frodo conn add` commands when Frodo was attempting to create service accounts with scopes that are not available in an environment.
- Updated dependencies with vulnerabilities

## [3.0.1] - 2025-02-06

### Changed

- Update to frodo-lib 3.0.1

## [3.0.0] - 2024-11-05

### Changed

- Update to frodo-lib 3.0.0
- Fixes and improvements to imports and exports:

  - Fixed an issue with file paths on the Windows version of Frodo that was causing errors on imports due to the differences between Windows and Linux file paths.
  - **_BREAKING_**: Updated IDM exports to be formatted the same as normal exports instead of as raw data by putting the raw data into a type object. This included changing the names of the exports to have a type ‘idm’, such as ‘sync.idm.json’ instead of ‘sync.json’, in order to reflect this change.
  - Added option to import an entity from a single file from the full export using the -f flag in the config import command.
  - Added option to do env substitution on single entity IDM exports/imports, and put logic for handling it all in Frodo-Lib
  - Added option to export/import all IDM entities to/from a single file using the -a flag
  - Added option to include or not include metadata in IDM exports
  - **_BREAKING_**: Updated exports for agents, secrets, and variables to have a singular rather than plural type to be more consistent with other exports (see frodo-lib PR for more information on this change)
  - Fixed a bug where the agent list command wouldn’t work if the agent had no status
  - Fixed a bug where oauth2 and managed applications were exported with the wrong type in a full export
  - Fixed a bug where journey imports weren’t working when importing using -D flag
  - Standardized file extraction since it is used in multiple places (namely scripts, sync mappings, and, in a future PR, servers).
  - Removed progress indicators for script, esv variable and esv secret describe commands since they caused Frodo to never terminate.
  - Improved config imports to be able to import individual files based on the file type in the name instead of on directory structure (although directory structure is still used to determine whether to import globally or to know which realm to import to).

## [2.1.0] - 2024-10-10

### Changed

- Update to frodo-lib 2.2.0

### Fixed

- \#445: Frodo now properly saves connection profiles and detects Advanced Identity Cloud deployment type.

## [2.0.6-2] - 2024-09-21

## [2.0.6-1] - 2024-09-09

## [2.0.6-0] - 2024-08-26

### Added

- Improve support for custom platform deployments (non-forgeops or customized forgeops)

  - \#429: Added options to support custom oauth2 clients used to obtain the access token for IDM API calls:

    - `--login-client-id <client-id>` Specify a custom OAuth2 client id to use a your own oauth2 client for IDM API calls in deployments of type "cloud" or "forgeops". Your custom client must be configured as a public client and allow the authorization code grant using the "openid fr:idm:\*" scope. Use the "--redirect-uri" parameter if you have configured a custom redirect uri (default: "<host>/platform/appAuthHelperRedirect.html").
    - `--login-redirect-uri <redirect-uri>` Specify a custom redirect URI to use with your custom OAuth2 client (efault: "<host>/platform/appAuthHelperRedirect.html").

    The above options can also be supplied through environment variables:

    - `FRODO_LOGIN_CLIENT_ID` OAuth2 client id for IDM API calls. Overridden by '--login-client-id' option.
    - `FRODO_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URI` Redirect Uri for custom OAuth2 client id. Overridden by '--login-redirect-uri' option.

  - \#359: Added an option to support custom IDM host URLs for all IDM API calls (e.g. platform deployments hosting AM and IDM on/in different DNS hosts/domains):

    - `--idm-host <idm-host>` IDM base URL, e.g.: <https://cdk.idm.example.com/myidm>. Use only if your IDM installation resides in a different domain and/or if the base path differs from the default "/openidm".

    The above option can also be supplied through an environment variable:

    - `FRODO_IDM_HOST` IDM base URL. Overridden by '--idm-host' option.

  **_Note:_** All the above options are also persisted in connection profiles so they only have to specified once and after that they come out of the connection profile.

### Changed

- Update to frodo-lib 2.1.2-0

## [2.0.5] - 2024-08-20

### Added

- Improvements to the `frodo script` commands:

  - Added the `-i`/`--script-id` option to import and export scripts by id.
  - Added the `--no-deps` option to not include library scripts in exports of single scripts. Similarly adds the option on single script imports using the same flag to not import library dependencies if so desired.

### Changed

- Update to frodo-lib 2.1.0

### Fixed

- Fixes to the handling of scripts in the `frodo script` commands and the `frodo config import` command:

  - Fixing many bugs related to script extraction. For example, there were certain cases where importing wouldn't function correctly due to being unable to find the extracted script(s). For exports, library scripts weren't being extracted correctly either. Therefore, an overhaul was done to try and help simplify the extraction process to that it can work for multiple scripts if dealing with library scripts both on export and import.
  - Fixing many errors in the watch option for script imports. One big one was if there were several scripts for a single json file (e.g. when exporting scripts with library scripts) that only one of the scripts would correctly be watched. This was fixed by creating mappings before watching begins to map extracted script files with their corresponding json files so it functions correctly.
  - Fixing a small bug with config imports where, if the working directory started with `.` or `./` it would usually fail due to being unable to locate the expected files it was looking for.

#### Global support for `-D`, `--directory` to set the working directory

2.x globally supports `-D`, `--directory` to specify the working directory for any command that interacts with the file system, typically `export` and `import` sub-commands. 1.x did only allow to specify a working directory for the `idm` command. Frodo combines `-D` and `-f` into a single path, assuming `-f` to be a relative path to `-D` and `-D` defaulting to `.`, the current directory:

To import the file `/absolute/path/to/working/directory/relative/path/to/file.variable.json`, one could construct any of the following commands:

```console
frodo esv variable export -f /absolute/path/to/working/directory/sub-path/to/file.variable.json <my-env>
frodo esv variable export -D /absolute/path/to/working/directory/sub-path/to  -f file.variable.json <my-env>
frodo esv variable export -D /absolute/path/to/working/directory -f sub-path/to/file.variable.json <my-env>
```

Alternatively, to import the file `/relative/path/to/working/directory/relative/path/to/file.variable.json`, one could construct any of the following commands:

```console
frodo esv variable export -f relative/path/to/working/directory/sub-path/to/file.variable.json <my-env>
frodo esv variable export -D relative/path/to/working/directory/sub-path/to  -f file.variable.json <my-env>
frodo esv variable export -D relative/path/to/working/directory -f sub-path/to/file.variable.json <my-env>
```

#### Secure Token Caching

Frodo CLI 2.x uses a secure token cache, which is active by default. The cache is tokenized and encrypted on disk, so it persists across CLI executions, dramatically decreasing authentication and token requests. You can disable the cache by either using the `--no-cache` option or by setting the `FRODO_NO_CACHE` environment variable.
You can change the default location of the cache file (`~/.frodo/TokenCache.json`) by setting the `FRODO_TOKEN_CACHE_PATH` environment variable.

#### Automatic Token Refresh

Frodo CLI 2.x automatically refreshes session and access tokens before they expire. Combined with the new token cache, the CLI maintains a set of valid tokens at all times.

## [2.0.0-70] - 2024-07-17

## [2.0.0-69] - 2024-07-15

- \#419: Developer: Updated command template with usage samples

### Changed

- Update to frodo-lib 2.0.0-95

## [2.0.0-68] - 2024-07-12

## [2.0.0-67] - 2024-07-11

### Added

- New commands to manage IDM mappings:

  - `frodo mapping`  Manage IDM mappings.
    - `delete`   Delete IDM mappings.
    - `export`   Export IDM mappings.
    - `import`   Import IDM mappings.
    - `list`     List IDM mappings.
    - `rename`   Renames mappings from the combined/default/legacy naming scheme (sync/\\<name>) to the separate/new naming scheme (mapping/\\<name>). To rename mappings from new back to legacy, use the -l, --legacy flag.

## [2.0.0-66] - 2024-07-10

### Added

- \#404: Frodo now saves the `-k`/`--insecure` option in connection profiles.

### Changed

- Update to frodo-lib 2.0.0-92

### Fixed

- \#400: Frodo now properly honors the `-k`/`--insecure` option and allows connecting to platform instances using self-signed certificates.

## [2.0.0-65] - 2024-07-06

### Add

- rockcarver/frodo-lib#387: Support import of ESVs (variables and secrets). Frodo now supports importing ESV variables and secrets with two new commands:
  - `frodo esv variable import`
  - `frodo esv secret import`

- Frodo now supports exporting (and importing) of ESV secret values. To leave stuartship of secret values with the cloud environment where they belong, frodo will always encrypt values using either encryption keys from the source environment (default) or the target environment (export option). Frodo will never export secrets in the clear. However, frodo supports importing clear values (as well as importing encrypted values). Use these new commands and parameters to export/import variables and secrets including secret values:

  - New parameters for existing `frodo esv secret export` and `frodo config export` commands:

    - `--include-active-values` Include the currently active (and loaded) secret value in the export. By default, secret values are encrypted server-side in the environment they are exported from. Use `--target <host url>` to have another environment perform the encryption.

    - `--target <host url>` Host URL of the environment to perform secret value encryption. The URL must resolve to an existing connection profile. Use this option to generate an export that can be imported into the target environment without requiring admin access to the source environment.

  - New `frodo esv secret import` and updated existing `frodo config import` command and note-worthy parameters:

    - `--include-active-values` Import any secret values contained in the import file. By default, secret values are encrypted server-side in the environment they are exported from. Use `--source <host url>` to import a file exported from another environment than the one you are importing to.

    - `--source <host url>` Host URL of the environment which performed secret value encryption. The URL must resolve to an existing connection profile. Use this option to import a file that was exported from a different source environment than the one you are importing to.

- rockcarver/frodo-lib#394: Support for `base64aes` encoding for ESV secrets

    `frodo authn describe --json <myTenant> <realm>`

    `frodo authn describe <myTenant> <username> <password>`

  - \#217: Support `--json` with `frodo esv variable describe`.

## [2.0.0-29] - 2023-11-02

### Added

- rockcarver/frodo-lib#53: Frodo Library now uses a file-based secure token cache to persist session and access tokens for re-use. The cached tokens are protected by the credential that was used to obtain them. Session tokens are encrypted using the hashed password as the master key, access tokens are encrypted using the hashed JWK private key as the master key. Therefore only users and processes with the correct credentials can access the tokens in the cache.

  - The new default behavior is for Frodo CLI to use the new token cache for all applicable commands.
  - A new global option `--no-cache` has been added to all commands to allow disabling the cache for indiviual invocations.
  - A new environment variable `FRODO_NO_CACHE` is available to globally turn off token caching.
  - A new environment variable `FRODO_TOKEN_CACHE_PATH` is available to instruct Frodo Library to use a non-default token cache file.

- rockcarver/frodo-lib#340: Frodo Library now autotomatically refreshes expired session and access tokens.

  - The new default behavior is for Frodo CLI to automatically refresh tokens. This will only ever be noticeable during long-running operations like `frodo journey prune` or `frodo esv apply` that can take longer than 15 mins to complete.

### Fixed

- \#316: Frodo Library now properly exports scripts referenced by the `Device Match` node if the `Use Custom Matching Script` option is selected.

- Support for authorization policies, policy sets, and resource types through new `authz` commands:

  - `frodo authz type`    Manage authorization resource types.
    - `delete`          Delete authorization resource types.
    - `describe`        Describe authorization resource types.
    - `export`          Export authorization resource types.
    - `import`          Import authorization resource types.
    - `list`            List authorization resource types.
  - `frodo authz set`     Manage authorization policy sets.
    - `delete`          Delete authorization policy sets.
    - `describe`        Describe authorization policy sets.
    - `export`          Export authorization policy sets.
    - `import`          Import authorization policy sets.
    - `list`            List authorization policy sets.
  - `frodo authz policy`  Manage authorization policies.
    - `delete`          Delete authorization policies.
    - `describe`        Describe authorization policies.

    - `import`          Import authorization policies.
    - `list`            List authorization policies.

  Examples:

  - Export a whole policy set including policies and resource types:<br>
    `frodo authz set export -i <myPolicySet> <myTenant>`
  - Import a whole policy set including dependencies exported using the previous example:<br>
    `frodo authz set import -f <myPolicySet>.policyset.authz.json <myTenant>`
  - Remove a whole policy set with all its policies:<br>
    `frodo authz set delete -i <myPolicySet> <myTenant>`
  - Export all policies in a policy set including dependencies:<br>
    `frodo authz policy export -a --set-id <myPolicySet> <myTenant>`
  - Import all policies into another policy set in another tenant:<br>
    `frodo authz policy import -a --set-id <myOtherPolicySet> -f <>.policy.authz.json <myOtherTenant>`<br>
    **_Note_**: Policy IDs/names have to be unique within the realm. Therefore you cannot export all policies from one policy set and import them into another policy set in the same realm without deleting the original policy set first.

  Notes:

  - Use the new `--prereqs` option with the `authz set/policy import/export` commands to include structural prerequisites like resource types and policy sets.
  - Use the new `--json` option with all `describe` sub-commands:<br>
    `frodo authz type describe --json -n URL <myTenant>`<br>
    `frodo authz type describe --json -i 76656a38-5f8e-401b-83aa-4ccb74ce88d2 <myTenant>`<br>

- Full support for Identity Cloud Service Accounts across all commands. Three options to leverage service accounts:

  1. Connection profiles for daily CLI usage:

     For daily admin and development tasks, using the new `frodo conn save` command (see details under next bullet) is the easiest way to get going with service accounts. To migrate an existing connection profile to service accounts and automatically create a service account for your tenant admin, simply issue the following command:

         % frodo conn save service-accounts
         Connected to https://openam-service-accounts.forgeblocks.com/am [alpha] as user volker.scheuber@forgerock.com
         Created and added service account Frodo-SA-1673586189578 with id 99c04bba-7213-463b-9a27-ceafa8a95734 to profile.
         Saved connection profile https://openam-service-accounts.forgeblocks.com/am
         %

     Then validate your connection profile is using the new service account:

         % frodo info service-accounts
         Connected to https://openam-service-accounts.forgeblocks.com/am [alpha] as service account Frodo-SA-1673586189578 [99c04bba-7213-463b-9a27-ceafa8a95734]

     Once you have verified that your service account works, go ahead and enable MFA for your tenant admin account!

  2. CLI parameters:

     All commands support the following new options to use service accounts:

     - `--sa-id <uuid>` Service account's uuid. If specified, must also include `--sa-jwk-file`.
     - `--sa-jwk-file <file>` File containing the service account's java web key (jwk). Jwk must contain private key! If specified, must also include `--sa-id`.

     This is a great way to leverage the nice UI to create and manage service accounts and then use one of the accounts with Frodo.

  3. Environment variables for CI/CD

     For CI/CD pipelines, environment variables are preferable over command line parameters, because they are not visible in system logs:

     - `FRODO_SA_ID`: Service account's uuid. If set, must also set `FRODO_SA_JWK`.
     - `FRODO_SA_JWK`: Service account's java web key (jwk) as single-line string. Jwk must contain private key! If set, must also set `FRODO_SA_ID`.

- \#143: Support Identity Cloud Service Accounts in `frodo conn save|add` command

  1. The `frodo conn add` command is renamed to `frodo conn save` and `add` is added as an alias for backwards compatibility.
  2. The `frodo conn save` command supports the following new options to manage service accounts:
     1. `--sa-id <uuid>` Service account's uuid. If specified, must also include `--sa-jwk-file`. Ignored with `--no-sa`.
     2. `--sa-jwk-file <file>` File containing the service account's java web key (jwk). Jwk must contain private key! If specified, must also include `--sa-id`. Ignored with `--no-sa`.
     3. `--no-sa` Do not add service account.
  3. The existing `--no-validate` option also applies to service account operations, allowing to add service account configuration to a connection profile without validating it, typical use case is an offline situation.
  4. The `frodo conn save` command automatically creates a new service account and adds it to an existing ID Cloud profile without service account or to a new ID Cloud profile. It does not do that if the `--no-sa` option is supplied.
     1. If `--sa-id` and `--sa-jwk-file` are supplied, `frodo conn save` adds the existing service account specified by those two parameters to the profile instead of creating a new service account.
     2. The `frodo conn save` command checks if the ID Cloud tenant supports service accounts before performing any service account operations.
  5. The `frodo conn save` command validates service account configuration unless the `--no-validate` options is supplied.

- Add support for additional environment variables:

  - `FRODO_SA_ID`: Service account's uuid. If set, must also set `FRODO_SA_JWK`.
  - `FRODO_SA_JWK`: Service account's java web key (jwk) as single-line string. Jwk must contain private key! If set, must also set `FRODO_SA_ID`.
  - `FRODO_AUTHENTICATION_SERVICE=journey`: Specify a login journey for frodo to use.
  - `FRODO_MOCK=1`: Enable mocking. If enabled, frodo-lib replays recorded API responses instead of connecting to a platform instance.
  - `FRODO_POLLY_LOG_LEVEL=info`: Frodo mock engine log level (`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `silent`). This is helpful for troubleshooting the mock capability, only.

  Environment variables added in 0.19.0:

  - `FRODO_HOST`
  - `FRODO_REALM`
  - `FRODO_USERNAME`
  - `FRODO_PASSWORD`
  - `FRODO_SA_ID`
  - `FRODO_SA_JWK`
  - `FRODO_LOG_KEY`
  - `FRODO_LOG_SECRET`
  - `FRODO_DEBUG`

- Enhanced the `frodo info` command to give more details for Identity Cloud tenants.

- Warn if IDM connector servers are offline

- Add mock mode for library to allow unit testing of clients using the library, like frodo-cli. This initial release contains minimal mock data. Enable mock mode using `FRODO_MOCK=1`.

  - Added journey/node classification:
    Classifications are shown for the whole journey and for each node type and node, making it easy to determine why a journey is classified a certain way.
    - `standard`: can run on any instance of a ForgeRock platform
    - `cloud`: utilize nodes, which are exclusively available in the ForgeRock Identity Cloud
    - `premium`: utilizes nodes, which come at a premium
    - `custom`: utilizes nodes not included in the ForgeRock platform release
  - Added journey categories/tags

### Fixed

- \#49: Frodo now properly reports missing mandatory parameters when running `frodo esv variable describe <host>` and `frodo esv secret describe <host>`

## [0.13.0] - 2022-09-17

### Added

- Frodo now allows two new parameters when adding a connection profile:

  \--authentication-service [service] Name of the authentication service/tree to use.

  \--authentication-header-overrides [headers] Map of headers: {"host":"am.example.com:8081"}.

  These parameters are currently only supported in the `frodo conn add` command and the configuration elements will be automatically applied to commands issued using that connection profile.

      % frodo conn add https://platform.example.com:9443/am username password --authentication-service ldapService --authentication-header-overrides '{"host":"am.example.com:8081"}' -k
      ForgeOps deployment detected.
      Connected to ForgeRock Access Management 7.2.0 Build 64ef7ebc01ed3df1a1264d7b0400351bc101361f (2022-June-27 08:15)

      %

  After the connection profile is created with the additional parameters, the environment can be accessed as usual. In this case it requires the `-k` parameter for every command, as the environment uses a self-signed certificate.

### Added

- Frodo CLI is now effectively using Frodo Library for all functionality except CLI.
  - This changes has no effect on users using frodo binaries except for the download location of those binaries, which has now shifted to the [frodo-cli](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-cli) repo [release section](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-cli/releases).
  - This change does affect users who run Frodo in `Developer Mode`. The exact effects and required actions are not yet fully documented and understood.
  - This change does not effect the installation/update/usage process of users running the Frodo CLI NPM package. However, under the surface there is a big change in that the [Frodo CLI (@rockcarver/frodo-cli)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rockcarver/frodo-cli) package is now built on the new [Frodo Library (@rockcarver/frodo-lib)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rockcarver/frodo-lib).

### Changed

- The output of `frodo -v` has changed to include all three versions: cli, lib, and node:
  ```console
  % frodo -v
  cli: v0.11.1-1
  lib: v0.11.1-6
  node: v18.7.0

### Added

- \#205: Added `--no-deps` option to `journey export`/`import` commands. This allows users to omit all external dependencies from a journey export and/or import. One use case where this comes in handy is when using frodo as a CI/CD tool to extract and deploy individual configuration artifacts and it is desirable to not mingle multiple types of configuration in a single file but keep each type of configuration in its own file for version and change control.
- Added `--verbose` option to `journey export` command.
- \#341: Added initial smoke tests to validate basic functionality.

### Changed

- \#363: Frodo now performs dependency resolution and reports unresolved dependencies on single journey imports.
- \#364: Frodo now uses a spinner and no longer a progress bar to indicate progress on single journey imports.
- Internal restructuring (#158, #159, #164, #165)
- Updated PIPELINE.md with latest pipeline changes

### Fixed

- \#359: Frodo now properly exports themes from forgeops deployments.
- \#362: Frodo now properly imports journeys with email templates.
- \#357: Frodo no longer throws an error and exits occasionally when running the `frodo log tail` command.
- \#355: Frodo now properly imports social IDPs into 7.1 environments when using the `frodo journey import` command.
- \#353: Frodo now properly imports social IDPs when using the `frodo journey import` command.
- \#351: Frodo now properly shows IDM messages using the `frodo logs tail` command.
